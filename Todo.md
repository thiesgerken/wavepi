# WavePI Todo List

## Direct Solver

* geometry should be a parameter of the class
* solution should be output of run()
* paraview output not automatically, maybe this should be a function of the solution (vector of all time steps) type
* grid adaptivity
* better log
* discretized parameters and rhs should also work (decide on a discretization ('solution type') first)
