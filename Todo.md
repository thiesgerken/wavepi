# WavePI Todo List

## Direct Solver

* grid adaptivity
* discretized parameters and rhs should also work in WaveEquation
* Interpolation of time steps (DiscretizedFunction::at)
* Test discretized stuff as parameters by 'wrapping' a discretized function in a normal one? -> make DiscretizedFunction extend Function ?!)
## Inversion

* implement L^2-Landweber / Shrinkage scheme (as  a class?)
